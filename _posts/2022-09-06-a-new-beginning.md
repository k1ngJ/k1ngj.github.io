## A skid was born

Back in 2013, when I first learned how to create spam bots and game hacks, it was all mainly for profit and glory. I was a 22 yr old seeking for validation. I want to feel adored and important. Thus, a *skid* was born.

It all started when I stumbled upon a website called ***Blackhatworld*** when I saw people generating money that I couldn't even fathom how to spend. There are people making $2,000 and upwards DAILY. Then I saw this one post, about an Instagram bot that will generate you money by spamming your own affiliate link from these advertising networks.

Around that time, my family's financial status is all-time-low. Our internet cafe business just went bankrupt, and my father is the only sole breadwinner for the family. So when I saw this, I knew this is the answer to our problems. But there is another problem: the Instagram bot costs $99. Which at that time is impossible for me to get.

## The solution

So what did I do? I searched for ways for me to have my own Instagram bot. Then I found a free program that does what exactly the $99 bot do, but it's a bit slower since it only relies on the Instagram's web version ( which at that time lacks some functionalities ) and had a lot of unnecessary clutters. But it did some unexpected results. On my first night running it, I made $9. And it's a free bot that everyone can use! What more if I can make my own, without relying on the web version, straight to the Instagram's undocumented API? So from there, a new reverse engineer guy was born. From figuring out the hashing method for each Instagram's request to moving on to new apps like Vine, I jumped ship to ship while making good amount of money.

## Today

From 2013 until this day, I'm still making a living doing game hacks and spam bots. But something in me clicked in that all of a sudden I don't wanna do this anymore. I want to upgrade my knowledge which was obsolete and still living in 2013. I want new challenges. So I'm gonna start in learning Cyber Security. Since I love reverse engineering so much, I figured this is where I would thrive the most. I would document my experience and findings in this blog for other aspiring newbies to learn from.

See you on the next chapters!
