Hello, I am Benjamin Barcenas, a 31 yr old random guy from the Philippines. I started from coding spam bots and game hacks in 2013, but recently became extremely interested in cyber security mainly in the reverse engineering side.
English is not my first language and I was only a high school graduate so please bear with any grammar or spelling errors.
